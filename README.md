# Kameleoon iOS SDK

## Getting Started

Our SDK gives you the possibility of running experiments and activating feature flags on iOS. Integrating our SDK into your applications is easy, and its footprint (in terms of memory and network usage) is low.

You can refer to the [SDK reference](https://developers.kameleoon.com/swift-sdk.html#reference) to check out all possible features of the SDK. Also make sure you check out our [Getting started tutorial](https://developers.kameleoon.com/swift-sdk.html#getting-started) which we have prepared to walk you through the installation and implementation.
